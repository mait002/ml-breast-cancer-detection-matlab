# 🧠 Breast Cancer Classification in MATLAB

This project uses machine learning models to classify breast cancer cases as malignant or benign based on the UCI Breast Cancer dataset.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- MATLAB
- Classification Learner App
- Supervised ML: Fine Tree, Neural Network
- Data preprocessing and evaluation

## 📁 Project Structure
- `data/`: Dataset files (.data/.names)
- `scripts/`: MATLAB scripts for import, training, and evaluation
- `models/`: Saved trained models

## 📊 Models Trained
- Fine Decision Tree
- Narrow Neural Network

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Open MATLAB and run the scripts in `scripts/`
3. Models will be trained and evaluated automatically

## 📈 Results
- Accuracy (Fine Tree): 92.4%
- Accuracy (Neural Network): 96.5%
